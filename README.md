# Example Project
This repo contained my example project list (something like trying new stuff or just trying new tech) from various field. All project here is my hobby project so some is just a try-tech project or a tutorial project.  

## Getting Started

Each of the list is its own individual repo so you can clone and try them individually. PS: some repo doesn't have its own readme and I'm still working on it.
